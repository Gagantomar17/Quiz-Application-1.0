# Quiz-Application-1.0
This is my first project in JAVA
I'm thrilled to share my latest achievement - I've just completed my first Java project! 🎉

📌 What I've Built:
I've developed a basic quiz application using Java, which includes key components like 
javax.swing, Java AWT, ActionListener, and ActionEvent packages. This project allowed 
me to put my coding skills to the test and apply fundamental 
Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts.

🧐 Project Highlights:
✅ User-friendly GUI with Java Swing
✅ Event handling using ActionListener and ActionEvent
✅ Utilized Java AWT for graphical components
✅ Tested my DSA knowledge to create efficient quiz logic
